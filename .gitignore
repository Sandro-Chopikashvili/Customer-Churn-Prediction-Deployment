# Data files (if they are large or sensitive, otherwise you can remove this)
# If your data/ folder contains very large datasets, you might want to ignore them
# and use Git LFS (Large File Storage) or just store a small sample.
# For now, it's probably fine to keep `data/` in Git for the Telco dataset.
# If the data file gets too big, uncomment this or specific files:
# data/

# Model files (if they get very large, use Git LFS later or ignore)
# For now, the .joblib file might be small enough, but good to know
# for larger models.
# models/*.joblib
# models/*.pkl
